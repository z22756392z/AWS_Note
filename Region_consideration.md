When working with AWS services, it's crucial to select the appropriate AWS region. It's worth noting that different regions can have variations in the services they offer and their pricing structures.

For example in ec2 and vpc is region specific, and IAM and s3 is global

>IAM(identity and aces management), s3(storage) 
>
>if top-right region selection is global that mean you can use this servce regardless of region.



### Availability Zones (AZ)

Availability Zones are smaller data center facilities within an AWS region that provide redundancy and stability. Each AWS region may comprise a different number of Availability Zones, with some regions having multiple Zones.

Availability Zones can be associated with different subnets within a region. You can manage these associations in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configuration.
